# Compass On Call Slack Bot

Compass is our operations manager. On it, we can define on call schedules for our teams. 

We used to have a `/oncall` command with BetterStack that would list all users on call. Since Compass does not provide that unless all users ar paid users, we created this service to provide the same command via a custom Slack APP.
